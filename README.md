# AniCountdown
An anime countdown bot for discord called "AniCountdown" made fully in JavaScript using discord.js.

## How it works
1) User types a command in discord asking which anime countdown it wants to see
2) Puppeteer is used within discord.js to pull in the data from https://www.livechart.me/search
3) The bot displays the data in a clean and formatted message reply
